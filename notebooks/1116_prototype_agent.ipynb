Cancer patients and survivors often continue to live in the same neighborhoods they resided in before their cancer diagnosis. Thus, patients and survivors are exposed to the same environmental contexts that likely contributed to their original cancer, but little is known about the health effects of continued exposure to carcinogens after a cancer diagnosis. This commentary provides a summary of studies of the association between PM2.5 and cancer mortality among patients and PM2.5 and posttreatment morbidity among cancer survivors, and proposes new directions and opportunities for future research on such topics.\\nIntroduction\\nIn this special section of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, there are several reports detailing the importance of environmental exposures on cancer etiology. The majority of research has focused on pollutants as a risk factor for new cancer development. However, cancer patients and survivors are exposed to environmental pollutants across their course of care and throughout survivorship. Environmental pollutants and other extrinsic factors contribute to an estimated 70% to 90% of cancers in humans (1), including ambient air pollution, which has been declared carcinogenic to humans (2). Since 2016, emissions of ambient air pollution across the United States have increased, and with it an additional estimated 10,000 deaths in geographic regions where air pollution has worsened (3, 4). The majority of cancer patients and survivors continue to live in the same place they resided in before their diagnosis (5). Their unchanged environmental context contains pollutants and other extrinsic factors that likely contributed to their initial cancer. We propose broadening the scope of understanding of air pollution’s effect on cancer from cancer etiology to include examinations of the effects of air pollution on the health of cancer patients during treatment and through survivorship. We suggest three key research priorities that are important for understanding the relationship between air pollution, cancer morbidity, and cancer mortality.\\nPriority #1—Disentangling the Relationship between Ambient Air Pollution, Cancer Survival, Tumor Aggressiveness, and Recurrence\\nPM2.5 is the most often studied environmental carcinogen in the context of cancer patient mortality thus far (6–11). Exposure to PM2.5 after diagnosis is associated with a significant increase in the risk for mortality among adult patients with lung, breast, kidney, bladder, and liver cancer even after controlling for socioeconomic status, race, and stage at diagnosis (6–13). In this issue, we report significant associations between PM2.5 and mortality among adolescent and young adult patients with central nervous system, breast, melanoma, and colorectal cancers, and mortality in patients with pediatric lymphoma, lymphoid leukemia, and central nervous system tumors. However, little is known about the timing of PM2.5 exposure that may be most critical to patient outcomes or the biological mechanisms at play. Proposed mechanisms by which PM2.5 may lead to cancer mortality are similar to those that induce or promote the original cancer, including genotoxic and epigenetic alterations, inflammation, xenogeneic effects or hormone dysregulation, or by reducing the immune system’s ability to fight the cancer (6–10). These mechanisms may also reduce the tumor’s sensitivity to cancer treatment, which is a novel mechanism unique to patients with cancer.\\nStudies of PM2.5 and cancer mortality that incorporate molecular markers and measures of cancer aggressiveness can enrich our understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to mortality. For example, comparing the association of PM2.5 and mortality in patients with ER+, PR+, or HER2+ breast cancer to mortality among patients with triple-negative breast cancers would provide more information about whether PM2.5 is operating through hormonal pathways. Our article in this issue and other studies of adult cancers report that the association of PM2.5 and mortality is higher among patients diagnosed with early-stage tumors (10, 11). Longitudinal measures of tumor aggressiveness would provide needed information about the effects of PM2.5 on cancer progression in these early-stage tumors (14, 15). Studies of PM2.5 and recurrent cancers are rare (11), but PM2.5 may be associated with overall recurrence, more aggressive recurrent cancers, and mortality from these recurrent cancers. Studies should also expand the types of pollutants studied to include the other five criteria air pollutants and air toxics.\\nPriority #2—Quantifying the Additive and Synergistic Effects of Ambient Air Pollution and Cancer Treatment on the Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Outcomes of Cancer Survivors\\nAir pollution and cancer treatments are associated with morbidity and mortality from the same underlying pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases (Table 1), yet little is known about the effects of dual exposure to these two risk factors among cancer patients and survivors. Pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases are among the leading noncancer causes of death among cancer patients and survivors (16–27). These diseases are a product of the pulmonary-toxic and cardiotoxic effects of chest radiation, surgeries, and certain chemotherapies used to treat cancer (18, 28). Because of these treatment-induced physiologic vulnerabilities, cancer survivors and patients may be more susceptible to pollution-related pulmonary or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than the general public (29).\\nTable 1.\\nPulmonary and cardiovascular diseases associated with cancer therapies and air pollution.\\nAbbreviations: C, chemotherapy; NO2, nitrogen dioxide; O3, ozone; R, radiation; S, surgery; SO2, sulfur dioxide.\\nThe idea that cancer treatments can produce significant physiologic vulnerability to environmental pollutants is novel. Our earlier case-crossover study was the first to examine effect modification of the association of PM2.5 by cancer treatment in relation to childhood cancer survivor morbidity (29). We found that childhood cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy have significantly higher odds for a respiratory hospitalization after exposure to PM2.5 than the general public. Young adult and older adult cancer patients also suffer from treatment-related pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases and are at high risk for pulmonary and cardiovascular death (20, 30). For example, patients with breast cancer with triple-negative tumors are at extremely high risk for cardiovascular illness and death due to the chemotherapy and chest radiation used in their treatment (20, 30). Yet, no studies have examined effect modification or interaction of PM2.5 or other pollutants by cancer treatments in relation to morbidity or mortality in adults.\\nDespite the potential for adverse effects, cancer treatments are necessary to save lives. In contrast, patient exposure to environmental pollutants is completely unneeded and preventable through the enforcement of air quality standards that protect the public. We advocate for more studies of the consequences of exposure to environmental pollutants on the noncancer morbidity and mortality among cancer patients and survivors, with a focus on effect modification of this association by different cancer treatments.\\nPriority #3—Identifying Populations of Cancer Patients and Survivors with the Highest Risk for the Adverse Effects of Ambient Air Pollution\\nRacial and ethnic minorities often live in more polluted neighborhoods and have reduced cancer survival compared with non-Hispanic White populations (31–38). Clinical studies of racial and ethnic disparities in cancer survival and posttreatment morbidity acknowledge that individual differences, such as tumor biology and healthcare access, are important contributors to excess disease and death (31–38). Studies of the effects of the environment on cancer survivor health have primarily been focused on the built environment (e.g., street connectivity, healthy food availability; refs. 39–41) or the social environment as measured by ethnic enclaves, ethnic density, or racial residential segregation (42–44). These studies acknowledge that neighborhoods with a higher percent of racial and ethnic minorities have more exposure to traffic-based air pollution and air toxics, which is a pattern also found in nationwide studies reporting disproportionately higher exposure to environmental pollutants among minority populations (45–47). To our best knowledge, the direct association of pollution exposure with morbidity and mortality among cancer patients and survivors who are racial and ethnic minorities has not been addressed in any studies.\\nBuilding Research Infrastructure to Meet These Priorities\\nTo our best knowledge, no federal funding mechanisms from the NIH have been awarded to investigators studying the effect of environmental carcinogens on cancer patients or survivors. We conducted a search of research studies funded by the NIH with the words “air pollution” and “cancer” in the project terms, title, and abstract between fiscal years 2010 and 2020, including active and inactive projects. All but one of the 68 funded studies were limited to pollution and cancer etiology or studies of exposure assessment. The one study of the environment and cancer survival focused on racial segregation and racism as measures of the environment. At the same time, greater investments in surveillance of recurrent cancers, chemotherapy and radiation doses as reported electronic treatment records, and recording of cancer patient residential histories are needed to accomplish such research. Claims data merged with cancer incidence data, such as SEER-Medicare, may be a good resource for such research, but do not provide coverage of cancer patients under the age of 65. Because young adult patients with cancer and survivors of childhood cancers may be at risk for PM2.5-related health problems, new data sources to study these younger populations are needed. Although research along this topic may prove challenging, improved funding opportunities and data resources can facilitate the growth of studies that examine how environmental carcinogens and other pollutants are associated with the health outcomes of cancer patients and survivors.\\nAs our understanding of the adverse effects of air pollution has grown, so has our knowledge of its particularly adverse effect in special populations. Those populations are currently defined by age (children and older adults), preexisting lung or heart disease, specific genetic polymorphisms, and low socioeconomic status (48). More studies are needed to determine whether cancer survivors should be considered a susceptible population. Cancer patients and survivors may be candidates for this consideration on the basis that cancer may increase their susceptibility to pollution-related mortality, and prior exposure to treatment with pulmonary and cardiotoxic therapies may also increase their risk for pollution-related morbidity.\\nThe passing of health-based regulatory standards for the six criteria air pollutants and the recognition of air pollution as a carcinogen were significant victories for public health. Yet, new scientific studies are continually needed to support evidence-based public health policies while pushing the boundaries of what we know. Identifying new vulnerable populations is one way to strengthen the case for better policies surrounding air pollution and other environmental pollutants linked to cancer mortality, aggressiveness, and recurrence (15, 49). Nearly 17 million people in the United States have ever been diagnosed with cancer and the number of people who survive cancer is growing with advances in detection and treatment (50). Although etiology is still vital to study, it is time forge onward and examine environmental carcinogenesis across the full cancer continuum.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the NIH/NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (5P30CA042014; principal investigator: Cornelia Ulrich), NIH Academic Career Development Award (K07 CA230150; to H.A.

Most of the global population resides in places where air pollution levels, due to emissions from industry, power generation, transportation and domestic burning, considerably exceed the World Health Organization’s health-based air quality guidelines. Outdoor air pollution poses an urgent worldwide public health challenge because it is ubiquitous and has numerous serious adverse human health effects including cancer. Currently, there is substantial evidence from studies of humans and experimental animals, as well as mechanistic evidence to support a causal link between outdoor (ambient) air pollution, and especially particulate matter (PM) in outdoor air, with lung cancer incidence and mortality. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of lung cancer deaths annually worldwide are attributable to PM air pollution. Epidemiological evidence on outdoor air pollution and risk of other types of cancer, such as bladder cancer or breast cancer is more limited. Outdoor air pollution may also be associated with poorer cancer survival though further research is needed. This report presents an overview of outdoor air pollutants, sources and global levels, as well as a description of epidemiological evidence linking outdoor air pollution with cancer incidence and mortality. Biological mechanisms of air pollution-derived carcinogenesis are also described.

This report presents an overview of outdoor air pollutants, sources and global levels, as well as a description of epidemiological evidence linking outdoor ambient air pollution with lung cancer incidence and mortality, followed by studies of other types of cancers in adults as well as childhood cancers, and biological mechanisms of air pollution-derived carcinogenesis. This report concludes by summarizing public health/policy recommendations, including multi-level interventions aimed at the individual, community, and regional scales. The specific role for the medical and healthcare community regarding prevention and advocacy, and recommendations for further research are also described.\\nSources and Levels of Outdoor Air Pollution\\nExposure to outdoor air pollution poses an urgent public health challenge worldwide because it is ubiquitous, affecting everyone, and has numerous serious adverse human health effects including cancer.2 Major primary air pollutants, those emitted directly into the environment largely as a result of combustion of fossil and biomass fuels, include gaseous pollutants (such as sulfur dioxide: SO2, nitrogen dioxide: NO2, carbon monoxide: CO, and volatile organic compounds: VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) (including carbonaceous aerosol particles, such as black soot). While CO is often low outdoors in the developed world today (due to the use of emissions controls such as catalytic converters on automobiles), high levels can be experienced near biomass burning sources, including wildfires.3 In addition, secondary air pollutants are formed in the atmosphere from primary pollutants, and include gaseous ozone (O3), a major component of photochemical smog, formed in the atmosphere when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbons such as VOCs react in the presence of sunlight. Similarly, particulate sulfate (e.g., sulfuric acid (H2SO4)) and nitrate (e.g., ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)) aerosols are commonly created in the atmosphere from SO2 and NOx, respectively. Primary combustion particles and secondary particles are small in diameter, and are often referred to as fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 (particles ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter). Submicron combustion-related PM2.5 are of particular health concern because they contain numerous toxic compounds (e.g., acids and heavy metals) and can penetrate deeper into the lung than the larger PM generated by natural processes, such as most windblown soil particle mass.4\\nAir pollutants are emitted and/or formed both outdoors and indoors, resulting in personal pollutant exposure levels that can differ from levels measured by routine ambient air pollution measurements at centrally located air monitoring stations. The most common health-related air pollutants of greatest concern are summarized in Table 1 and are categorized into three classes: 1) pollutants primarily emitted into the outdoor environment; 2) pollutants primarily emitted into the indoor environment; and, 3) pollutants emitted into both outdoor and indoor environments. These pollutants and their typical sources are noted, including: PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO. Subsequent discussions herein will focus on outdoor air pollutants that are associated with cancer, especially PM and its constituents.\\nTable 1.\\nCommon health impacting air pollutants, grouped by origin\\nAdapted from: World Health Organization (WHO). Estimating Human Exposures to Air Pollutants. Offset Pub. No. 69. Geneva: World Health Organization; 1982 and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Outdoor Air Pollution. Volume 109. Lyon: International Agency for Research on Cancer; 2013.\\nPM represents a broad class of chemically and physically diverse aerosols comprised of solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the air. Such aerosols can be characterized by their size (discussed below), formation mechanism, origin, chemical composition, atmospheric behavior and method of measurement. The concentration of particles in the air varies across space and time and reflects the source of the particles and the pollutant transformations that occur in the atmosphere. PM air pollution can also be viewed in two major components: “primary” PM, including “soot” emitted directly into the atmosphere by combustion pollution sources such as industry, electric power plants, diesel buses, and automobiles, and; “secondary” PM, formed in the atmosphere from primary gaseous pollutants, such as SO2 and NOx gases (discussed above). Other primary sources include non-exhaust traffic emissions and windblown dusts from roadways, construction sites, agriculture, and deserts. Desert dust clouds have been documented to be capable of impacting population centers by being transported long distances.5\\nPM is commonly characterized according to the following size fractions:\\nThe mass concentration (as μg/m3) is the common metric used to evaluate and regulate PM pollution, though some constituents, such as lead (Pb) concentration, have been separately regulated. While UFPs usually make up only a small fraction of PM2.5 mass, UFPs commonly account for a majority of the number concentration of particles in PM2.5. It has been hypothesized based on toxicological studies that UFPs may be an especially toxic component of PM2.5 because of their small size, large numbers, and large surface area to mass ratio, but epidemiological evidence is currently sparse.6\\nPM2.5 is directly emitted from combustion sources, and is also formed from gaseous precursors, such as SO2 and NOx, or organic compounds (discussed above). In some areas and under some conditions, these secondary particles make up a substantial proportion of the PM2.5 mass. Secondary fine particles are commonly composed of sulfate, nitrate, chloride and ammonium compounds, organic carbon, and condensed metals. Combustion of fossil fuels, and especially coal, further results in PM2.5 that is highly enriched in multiple moderately volatile, and potentially toxic elements. These include the chalcophile elements such as zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and cadmium (Cd).7 Indeed, coal combustion has been found to account for approximately one-quarter of the world’s emissions of both As and mercury (Hg).8,9 PM2.5 can remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks, and travel through the atmosphere hundreds to thousands of kilometers;5 conversely most coarse particles typically deposit to the earth within minutes to hours and travel within only tens of kilometers from the emission source.\\nThe global population-weighted mean annual average PM2.5 concentration was 46 μg/m3 in 2017, four-fold greater than the WHO’s health-based world air quality guideline of 10 μg/m3 (Figure 1).10 Ninety-two percent of the global population worldwide lives in areas where ambient PM2.5 concentrations exceed the WHO guideline and large percentages of the populations of China, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nigeria have exposures above the WHO’s highest interim target guideline of 35 μg/m3. Among the ten largest countries by population, population-weighted ambient PM2.5 in 2017 varied by more than 12-fold; from 7 μg/m3 in the United States to 91 μg/m3 in India. For NO2, global population-weighted mean concentrations were estimated to be 1.6 ppb during 1996–2012, and were observed to have increased by 0.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6–1.1) per year during that time.11 Areas with the highest population-weighted mean concentrations were high-income Asia Pacific (4.9 ppb), Western Europe (4.1 ppb), and high income North America (3.7 ppb), though there was a decreasing trend ranging from 2.1 to 4.7% per year. Population-weighted mean concentrations in East Asia were 2.9 ppm and increasing at the highest rate of 6.7% per year. In contrast, population-weighted mean concentrations in areas of South and Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean were ≤ 0.5 ppb. The global population-weighted mean O3 concentration worldwide was 57 ppb in 2017, unchanged from 1990.10\\nAverage annual population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations in 2017.

IHME, 2018.\\nAn overview of the epidemiological evidence linking outdoor ambient air pollution with lung cancer incidence and mortality is provided below, followed by studies of other types of cancers in adults and children. Studies were identified through literature searches of Medline through June 2020, reference lists of identified studies and authoritative reports, as well as via personal correspondence. Although numerous epidemiological studies have evaluated some aspect of the association of outdoor air pollution and cancer, here we sought to highlight key contributions including meta-analyses and large-scale original studies, with a focus on the most recent and informative published literature. Methodological considerations and research needs are also discussed.\\nEpidemiological Studies of Outdoor Air Pollution and Lung Cancer\\nLung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 2.1 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths occurring in 2018, representing 11.6% of all new cancer diagnoses and 18.4% of all cancer deaths.12 In the United States, approximately 234,030 new lung cancer cases occurred and 154,050 deaths were estimated in the same year.13 Lung cancer is highly fatal, with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 18%.13 Rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality vary substantially within and between countries, depending largely on historical patterns of cigarette smoking,12 with long latency periods of up to approximately 30 years between the start of the smoking epidemic and the rise of lung cancer incidence. The highest incidence rates for lung cancer among men are currently observed in Micronesia/Polynesia, Eastern Asia, and Eastern Europe, and for women in North America, Northern and Western Europe, and Australia/New Zealand.12 In several European countries, lung cancer incidence rates are beginning to converge in men and women as increasing rates in women are approaching declining rates in men.12\\nAlthough cigarette smoking accounts for more than 80% of lung cancers, substantial numbers of lung cancer cases are observed among never smokers. Outdoor ambient air pollution and exposure to other inhalable agents, such as household burning of solid fuels, residential radon, second hand tobacco smoke, asbestos, certain metals and organic chemicals, and work in rubber manufacturing, paving, roofing, painting, or chimney sweeping, and other occupational exposures have also been associated with lung cancer risk.12–14\\nBased on sufficient evidence in studies of humans and experimental animals, as well as strong mechanistic evidence, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2013 classified both outdoor air pollution and PM '}],\n",

This commentary provides a summary of studies of the association between PM2.5 and cancer mortality among patients and PM2.5 and posttreatment morbidity among cancer survivors, and proposes new directions and opportunities for future research on such topics.\\nIntroduction\\nIn this special section of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, there are several reports detailing the importance of environmental exposures on cancer etiology. The majority of research has focused on pollutants as a risk factor for new cancer development. However, cancer patients and survivors are exposed to environmental pollutants across their course of care and throughout survivorship. Environmental pollutants and other extrinsic factors contribute to an estimated 70% to 90% of cancers in humans (1), including ambient air pollution, which has been declared carcinogenic to humans (2). Since 2016, emissions of ambient air pollution across the United States have increased, and with it an additional estimated 10,000 deaths in geographic regions where air pollution has worsened (3, 4). The majority of cancer patients and survivors continue to live in the same place they resided in before their diagnosis (5). Their unchanged environmental context contains pollutants and other extrinsic factors that likely contributed to their initial cancer. We propose broadening the scope of understanding of air pollution’s effect on cancer from cancer etiology to include examinations of the effects of air pollution on the health of cancer patients during treatment and through survivorship. We suggest three key research priorities that are important for understanding the relationship between air pollution, cancer morbidity, and cancer mortality.\\nPriority #1—Disentangling the Relationship between Ambient Air Pollution, Cancer Survival, Tumor Aggressiveness, and Recurrence\\nPM2.5 is the most often studied environmental carcinogen in the context of cancer patient mortality thus far (6–11). Exposure to PM2.5 after diagnosis is associated with a significant increase in the risk for mortality among adult patients with lung, breast, kidney, bladder, and liver cancer even after controlling for socioeconomic status, race, and stage at diagnosis (6–13). In this issue, we report significant associations between PM2.5 and mortality among adolescent and young adult patients with central nervous system, breast, melanoma, and colorectal cancers, and mortality in patients with pediatric lymphoma, lymphoid leukemia, and central nervous system tumors. However, little is known about the timing of PM2.5 exposure that may be most critical to patient outcomes or the biological mechanisms at play. Proposed mechanisms by which PM2.5 may lead to cancer mortality are similar to those that induce or promote the original cancer, including genotoxic and epigenetic alterations, inflammation, xenogeneic effects or hormone dysregulation, or by reducing the immune system’s ability to fight the cancer (6–10). These mechanisms may also reduce the tumor’s sensitivity to cancer treatment, which is a novel mechanism unique to patients with cancer.\\nStudies of PM2.5 and cancer mortality that incorporate molecular markers and measures of cancer aggressiveness can enrich our understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to mortality. For example, comparing the association of PM2.5 and mortality in patients with ER+, PR+, or HER2+ breast cancer to mortality among patients with triple-negative breast cancers would provide more information about whether PM2.5 is operating through hormonal pathways. Our article in this issue and other studies of adult cancers report that the association of PM2.5 and mortality is higher among patients diagnosed with early-stage tumors (10, 11). Longitudinal measures of tumor aggressiveness would provide needed information about the effects of PM2.5 on cancer progression in these early-stage tumors (14, 15). Studies of PM2.5 and recurrent cancers are rare (11), but PM2.5 may be associated with overall recurrence, more aggressive recurrent cancers, and mortality from these recurrent cancers. Studies should also expand the types of pollutants studied to include the other five criteria air pollutants and air toxics.\\nPriority #2—Quantifying the Additive and Synergistic Effects of Ambient Air Pollution and Cancer Treatment on the Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Outcomes of Cancer Survivors\\nAir pollution and cancer treatments are associated with morbidity and mortality from the same underlying pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases (Table 1), yet little is known about the effects of dual exposure to these two risk factors among cancer patients and survivors. Pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases are among the leading noncancer causes of death among cancer patients and survivors (16–27). These diseases are a product of the pulmonary-toxic and cardiotoxic effects of chest radiation, surgeries, and certain chemotherapies used to treat cancer (18, 28). Because of these treatment-induced physiologic vulnerabilities, cancer survivors and patients may be more susceptible to pollution-related pulmonary or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than the general public (29).\\nTable 1.\\nPulmonary and cardiovascular diseases associated with cancer therapies and air pollution.\\nAbbreviations: C, chemotherapy; NO2, nitrogen dioxide; O3, ozone; R, radiation; S, surgery; SO2, sulfur dioxide.\\nThe idea that cancer treatments can produce significant physiologic vulnerability to environmental pollutants is novel. Our earlier case-crossover study was the first to examine effect modification of the association of PM2.5 by cancer treatment in relation to childhood cancer survivor morbidity (29). We found that childhood cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy have significantly higher odds for a respiratory hospitalization after exposure to PM2.5 than the general public. Young adult and older adult cancer patients also suffer from treatment-related pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases and are at high risk for pulmonary and cardiovascular death (20, 30). For example, patients with breast cancer with triple-negative tumors are at extremely high risk for cardiovascular illness and death due to the chemotherapy and chest radiation used in their treatment (20, 30). Yet, no studies have examined effect modification or interaction of PM2.5 or other pollutants by cancer treatments in relation to morbidity or mortality in adults.\\nDespite the potential for adverse effects, cancer treatments are necessary to save lives. In contrast, patient exposure to environmental pollutants is completely unneeded and preventable through the enforcement of air quality standards that protect the public. We advocate for more studies of the consequences of exposure to environmental pollutants on the noncancer morbidity and mortality among cancer patients and survivors, with a focus on effect modification of this association by different cancer treatments.\\nPriority #3—Identifying Populations of Cancer Patients and Survivors with the Highest Risk for the Adverse Effects of Ambient Air Pollution\\nRacial and ethnic minorities often live in more polluted neighborhoods and have reduced cancer survival compared with non-Hispanic White populations (31–38). Clinical studies of racial and ethnic disparities in cancer survival and posttreatment morbidity acknowledge that individual differences, such as tumor biology and healthcare access, are important contributors to excess disease and death (31–38). Studies of the effects of the environment on cancer survivor health have primarily been focused on the built environment (e.g., street connectivity, healthy food availability; refs. 39–41) or the social environment as measured by ethnic enclaves, ethnic density, or racial residential segregation (42–44). These studies acknowledge that neighborhoods with a higher percent of racial and ethnic minorities have more exposure to traffic-based air pollution and air toxics, which is a pattern also found in nationwide studies reporting disproportionately higher exposure to environmental pollutants among minority populations (45–47). To our best knowledge, the direct association of pollution exposure with morbidity and mortality among cancer patients and survivors who are racial and ethnic minorities has not been addressed in any studies.\\nBuilding Research Infrastructure to Meet These Priorities\\nTo our best knowledge, no federal funding mechanisms from the NIH have been awarded to investigators studying the effect of environmental carcinogens on cancer patients or survivors. We conducted a search of research studies funded by the NIH with the words “air pollution” and “cancer” in the project terms, title, and abstract between fiscal years 2010 and 2020, including active and inactive projects. All but one of the 68 funded studies were limited to pollution and cancer etiology or studies of exposure assessment. The one study of the environment and cancer survival focused on racial segregation and racism as measures of the environment. At the same time, greater investments in surveillance of recurrent cancers, chemotherapy and radiation doses as reported electronic treatment records, and recording of cancer patient residential histories are needed to accomplish such research. Claims data merged with cancer incidence data, such as SEER-Medicare, may be a good resource for such research, but do not provide coverage of cancer patients under the age of 65. Because young adult patients with cancer and survivors of childhood cancers may be at risk for PM2.5-related health problems, new data sources to study these younger populations are needed. Although research along this topic may prove challenging, improved funding opportunities and data resources can facilitate the growth of studies that examine how environmental carcinogens and other pollutants are associated with the health outcomes of cancer patients and survivors.\\nAs our understanding of the adverse effects of air pollution has grown, so has our knowledge of its particularly adverse effect in special populations. Those populations are currently defined by age (children and older adults), preexisting lung or heart disease, specific genetic polymorphisms, and low socioeconomic status (48). More studies are needed to determine whether cancer survivors should be considered a susceptible population. Cancer patients and survivors may be candidates for this consideration on the basis that cancer may increase their susceptibility to pollution-related mortality, and prior exposure to treatment with pulmonary and cardiotoxic therapies may also increase their risk for pollution-related morbidity.\\nThe passing of health-based regulatory standards for the six criteria air pollutants and the recognition of air pollution as a carcinogen were significant victories for public health. Yet, new scientific studies are continually needed to support evidence-based public health policies while pushing the boundaries of what we know. Identifying new vulnerable populations is one way to strengthen the case for better policies surrounding air pollution and other environmental pollutants linked to cancer mortality, aggressiveness, and recurrence (15, 49). Nearly 17 million people in the United States have ever been diagnosed with cancer and the number of people who survive cancer is growing with advances in detection and treatment (50). Although etiology is still vital to study, it is time forge onward and examine environmental carcinogenesis across the full cancer continuum.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the NIH/NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (5P30CA042014; principal investigator: Cornelia Ulrich), NIH Academic Career Development Award (K07 CA230150; to H.A.

Most of the global population resides in places where air pollution levels, due to emissions from industry, power generation, transportation and domestic burning, considerably exceed the World Health Organization’s health-based air quality guidelines. Outdoor air pollution poses an urgent worldwide public health challenge because it is ubiquitous and has numerous serious adverse human health effects including cancer. Currently, there is substantial evidence from studies of humans and experimental animals, as well as mechanistic evidence to support a causal link between outdoor (ambient) air pollution, and especially particulate matter (PM) in outdoor air, with lung cancer incidence and mortality. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of lung cancer deaths annually worldwide are attributable to PM air pollution. Epidemiological evidence on outdoor air pollution and risk of other types of cancer, such as bladder cancer or breast cancer is more limited. Outdoor air pollution may also be associated with poorer cancer survival though further research is needed. This report presents an overview of outdoor air pollutants, sources and global levels, as well as a description of epidemiological evidence linking outdoor air pollution with cancer incidence and mortality. Biological mechanisms of air pollution-derived carcinogenesis are also described.

This report presents an overview of outdoor air pollutants, sources and global levels, as well as a description of epidemiological evidence linking outdoor ambient air pollution with lung cancer incidence and mortality, followed by studies of other types of cancers in adults as well as childhood cancers, and biological mechanisms of air pollution-derived carcinogenesis. This report concludes by summarizing public health/policy recommendations, including multi-level interventions aimed at the individual, community, and regional scales. The specific role for the medical and healthcare community regarding prevention and advocacy, and recommendations for further research are also described.\\nSources and Levels of Outdoor Air Pollution\\nExposure to outdoor air pollution poses an urgent public health challenge worldwide because it is ubiquitous, affecting everyone, and has numerous serious adverse human health effects including cancer.2 Major primary air pollutants, those emitted directly into the environment largely as a result of combustion of fossil and biomass fuels, include gaseous pollutants (such as sulfur dioxide: SO2, nitrogen dioxide: NO2, carbon monoxide: CO, and volatile organic compounds: VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) (including carbonaceous aerosol particles, such as black soot). While CO is often low outdoors in the developed world today (due to the use of emissions controls such as catalytic converters on automobiles), high levels can be experienced near biomass burning sources, including wildfires.3 In addition, secondary air pollutants are formed in the atmosphere from primary pollutants, and include gaseous ozone (O3), a major component of photochemical smog, formed in the atmosphere when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbons such as VOCs react in the presence of sunlight. Similarly, particulate sulfate (e.g., sulfuric acid (H2SO4)) and nitrate (e.g., ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)) aerosols are commonly created in the atmosphere from SO2 and NOx, respectively. Primary combustion particles and secondary particles are small in diameter, and are often referred to as fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 (particles ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter). Submicron combustion-related PM2.5 are of particular health concern because they contain numerous toxic compounds (e.g., acids and heavy metals) and can penetrate deeper into the lung than the larger PM generated by natural processes, such as most windblown soil particle mass.4\\nAir pollutants are emitted and/or formed both outdoors and indoors, resulting in personal pollutant exposure levels that can differ from levels measured by routine ambient air pollution measurements at centrally located air monitoring stations. The most common health-related air pollutants of greatest concern are summarized in Table 1 and are categorized into three classes: 1) pollutants primarily emitted into the outdoor environment; 2) pollutants primarily emitted into the indoor environment; and, 3) pollutants emitted into both outdoor and indoor environments. These pollutants and their typical sources are noted, including: PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO. Subsequent discussions herein will focus on outdoor air pollutants that are associated with cancer, especially PM and its constituents.\\nTable 1.\\nCommon health impacting air pollutants, grouped by origin\\nAdapted from: World Health Organization (WHO). Estimating Human Exposures to Air Pollutants. Offset Pub. No. 69. Geneva: World Health Organization; 1982 and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Outdoor Air Pollution. Volume 109. Lyon: International Agency for Research on Cancer; 2013.\\nPM represents a broad class of chemically and physically diverse aerosols comprised of solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the air. Such aerosols can be characterized by their size (discussed below), formation mechanism, origin, chemical composition, atmospheric behavior and method of measurement. The concentration of particles in the air varies across space and time and reflects the source of the particles and the pollutant transformations that occur in the atmosphere. PM air pollution can also be viewed in two major components: “primary” PM, including “soot” emitted directly into the atmosphere by combustion pollution sources such as industry, electric power plants, diesel buses, and automobiles, and; “secondary” PM, formed in the atmosphere from primary gaseous pollutants, such as SO2 and NOx gases (discussed above). Other primary sources include non-exhaust traffic emissions and windblown dusts from roadways, construction sites, agriculture, and deserts. Desert dust clouds have been documented to be capable of impacting population centers by being transported long distances.5\\nPM is commonly characterized according to the following size fractions:\\nThe mass concentration (as μg/m3) is the common metric used to evaluate and regulate PM pollution, though some constituents, such as lead (Pb) concentration, have been separately regulated. While UFPs usually make up only a small fraction of PM2.5 mass, UFPs commonly account for a majority of the number concentration of particles in PM2.5. It has been hypothesized based on toxicological studies that UFPs may be an especially toxic component of PM2.5 because of their small size, large numbers, and large surface area to mass ratio, but epidemiological evidence is currently sparse.6\\nPM2.5 is directly emitted from combustion sources, and is also formed from gaseous precursors, such as SO2 and NOx, or organic compounds (discussed above). In some areas and under some conditions, these secondary particles make up a substantial proportion of the PM2.5 mass. Secondary fine particles are commonly composed of sulfate, nitrate, chloride and ammonium compounds, organic carbon, and condensed metals. Combustion of fossil fuels, and especially coal, further results in PM2.5 that is highly enriched in multiple moderately volatile, and potentially toxic elements. These include the chalcophile elements such as zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and cadmium (Cd).7 Indeed, coal combustion has been found to account for approximately one-quarter of the world’s emissions of both As and mercury (Hg).8,9 PM2.5 can remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks, and travel through the atmosphere hundreds to thousands of kilometers;5 conversely most coarse particles typically deposit to the earth within minutes to hours and travel within only tens of kilometers from the emission source.\\nThe global population-weighted mean annual average PM2.5 concentration was 46 μg/m3 in 2017, four-fold greater than the WHO’s health-based world air quality guideline of 10 μg/m3 (Figure 1).10 Ninety-two percent of the global population worldwide lives in areas where ambient PM2.5 concentrations exceed the WHO guideline and large percentages of the populations of China, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nigeria have exposures above the WHO’s highest interim target guideline of 35 μg/m3. Among the ten largest countries by population, population-weighted ambient PM2.5 in 2017 varied by more than 12-fold; from 7 μg/m3 in the United States to 91 μg/m3 in India. For NO2, global population-weighted mean concentrations were estimated to be 1.6 ppb during 1996–2012, and were observed to have increased by 0.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6–1.1) per year during that time.11 Areas with the highest population-weighted mean concentrations were high-income Asia Pacific (4.9 ppb), Western Europe (4.1 ppb), and high income North America (3.7 ppb), though there was a decreasing trend ranging from 2.1 to 4.7% per year. Population-weighted mean concentrations in East Asia were 2.9 ppm and increasing at the highest rate of 6.7% per year. In contrast, population-weighted mean concentrations in areas of South and Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean were ≤ 0.5 ppb. The global population-weighted mean O3 concentration worldwide was 57 ppb in 2017, unchanged from 1990.10\\nAverage annual population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations in 2017.

IHME, 2018.\\nAn overview of the epidemiological evidence linking outdoor ambient air pollution with lung cancer incidence and mortality is provided below, followed by studies of other types of cancers in adults and children. Studies were identified through literature searches of Medline through June 2020, reference lists of identified studies and authoritative reports, as well as via personal correspondence. Although numerous epidemiological studies have evaluated some aspect of the association of outdoor air pollution and cancer, here we sought to highlight key contributions including meta-analyses and large-scale original studies, with a focus on the most recent and informative published literature. Methodological considerations and research needs are also discussed.\\nEpidemiological Studies of Outdoor Air Pollution and Lung Cancer\\nLung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 2.1 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths occurring in 2018, representing 11.6% of all new cancer diagnoses and 18.4% of all cancer deaths.12 In the United States, approximately 234,030 new lung cancer cases occurred and 154,050 deaths were estimated in the same year.13 Lung cancer is highly fatal, with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 18%.13 Rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality vary substantially within and between countries, depending largely on historical patterns of cigarette smoking,12 with long latency periods of up to approximately 30 years between the start of the smoking epidemic and the rise of lung cancer incidence. The highest incidence rates for lung cancer among men are currently observed in Micronesia/Polynesia, Eastern Asia, and Eastern Europe, and for women in North America, Northern and Western Europe, and Australia/New Zealand.12 In several European countries, lung cancer incidence rates are beginning to converge in men and women as increasing rates in women are approaching declining rates in men.12\\nAlthough cigarette smoking accounts for more than 80% of lung cancers, substantial numbers of lung cancer cases are observed among never smokers. Outdoor ambient air pollution and exposure to other inhalable agents, such as household burning of solid fuels, residential radon, second hand tobacco smoke, asbestos, certain metals and organic chemicals, and work in rubber manufacturing, paving, roofing, painting, or chimney sweeping, and other occupational exposures have also been associated with lung cancer risk.12–14\\nBased on sufficient evidence in studies of humans and experimental animals, as well as strong mechanistic evidence, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2013 classified both outdoor air pollution and PM '}],\n",
